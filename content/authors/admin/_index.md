Dr. Sean Grant is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Social & Behavioral Sciences at the IU Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health. He completed his doctorate in social intervention as a Clarendon Scholar at the Centre for Evidence-Based Intervention, University of Oxford. Prior to joining FSPH, he spent several years as a Social and Behavioral Scientist at the RAND Corporation, Faculty at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, and Lecturer at Loyola Marymount University. He currently is an Associate Editor for the journals *Trials* and *Systematic Reviews*, Associate Methods Editor for *Campbell Systematic Reviews*, Methodological Transparency Editor for *Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness*, and an Editorial Board member for *Prevention Science*.

The ultimate goal of Dr. Grant's research is to advance evidence-based practice: i.e., the use of scientific evidence to inform decisions about public health policies and programs. In pursuit of this goal, his scholarship focuses on social and behavioral research methods used to create evidence for public health decision-making. This type of work is known as “meta-research” (or “research on research”), as it seeks to increase the quality of scientific evidence by studying how research is done and how it can be improved. He particularly focuses on where improvements can be made in three areas: open science, research synthesis methods, and stakeholder engagement. His work involves both studying how others have applied these methods, as well as applications of these methods in translational research on specific public health issues (such as substance use and mental health).
